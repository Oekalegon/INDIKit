## Overview

`INDIKit` is a Swift client library for the INDI protocol, which is defined and implemented by the [INDI project](https://indilib.org/). It lets you talk to an INDI server from Swift, so your apps can discover devices, send commands, and react to status updates over the INDI protocol without having to deal with its low‑level details.
